Being on lockdown doesn't have to be boring, not if you keep yourself occupied. From learning a language to organising your wardrobe, updating your CV to writing a novel, there are plenty of productive things you can take up to pass the time - why not start right now? </h2></p>

   <p>
Got a wardrobe full of clothes that you hardly ever wear? Or lots of basic staples that lack personality? You can update, reuse, or upcycle everything from old t-shirts to shoes and garden pots! </p>

   <p>3. LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE</p>
   <p>Remember all those times you said you'd learn Italian, Spanish or French but just couldn't find a spare minute? Here's your chance. With a wide selection of YouTube videos and online tutorials at your disposal, why not use this time to learn a completely new language with Duolingo?</p>

    <p>5. CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS.</p>
    <p>There are so many other creative ways you can use video-calls. For example, how about watching Netflix with someone - not together in person but together by screen? Or how about a virtual dinner date? All you need is one of these platforms to make a live call. You then simply cook together via video, following the same steps, and you can enjoy your meal with someone!</p>

    <p>7. READ BOOKS AND LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS.</p>
    <p>If your new year’s resolution was to read more, you can definitely achieve that this year.

If you prefer audiobooks, try out Audible for free.Whether you're already a regular reader, or you can't remember the last time you finished a book - this is the perfect time to get lost in a good story. </p>

    <p>8. CLEAN YOUR HOUSE.</p>
    <p>Being stuck at home can make you rethink how much of your stuff you really need.
Between dusty skirting boards, dirty tiling, and stained carpets, your home can offer days of distraction if you feel like doing that deep clean you’ve been putting off. You can decide what to donate and what to throw out, ready for a full clear out when the lockdown is lifted. </p>

    <p>9. DECLUTTER YOUR WARDROBE.</p>
    <p>Most of us have at least one dress that we know we'll never wear again or a pair of jeans that just don't fit the way they used to. It's time to declutter your wardrobe and get rid of those sad pieces that no longer see the light of day.</p>
    <p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1RFVzsYZ/clean-closet.jpg"</p>
    <p>10. WRITE A NOVEL.</p>
    <p>If you’ve always wanted to write a novel but never found the time or inspiration, this is your chance. Apparently Shakespeare wrote King Lear in isolation during the plague, so maybe this lockdown is when you’ll write your opus.The idea of writing a novel is one which can often seem daunting. How many of us have opened Word, stared at a blank page for a while and then admitted defeat? Enough is enough. Writing can be an incredibly therapeutic practice and one which can help to pass the time. Who knows, you might even be the next J.K. Rowling?  </p>

    <p>11. MAKE A BUCKET LIST.</p>
    <p>Think positive and look ahead to sunnier days by making a bucket list. Rather than wallowing in your pyjamas for the fifth day in a row (we've all been there) change your outlook and reflect on all of the things you'll be able to do once lockdown restrictions are lifted. Looking to travel more? These scratch-off maps are perfect for planning your next adventure post COVID-19.  </p>

    <p>12. WORKOUT.</p>
    <p>Missing the gym? Working out at home can be just as beneficial for both your mind and body. Why not try out different types of workouts over the course of the next few weeks and find that workout that really works for you. </p>
